# Basic-E-Commerce-Page
A basic "choose your product then checkout" e-commerce type page. PHP and XAMPP was used for the basic database back-end.

The first thing that the user will be asked is to input their name once they access the page. Once the user inputs his/her name, then it will proceed to show the business site. Their name will be reflected at the site at the top with the words: Welcome <name>! This will refresh the same page and not open another tab/window.

At the end of your website page, user select a particular product they wish to avail from the shop and its quantity. Once done, they will click on the Checkout button then it will show a confirmation message that the order has been processed. 

At the backend part, this new data will be inserted into the database table which will include the user name. At the front-end, it outputs all contents of the ORDER table which includes the newly added data.
